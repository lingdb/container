Notes from viewing the site with Cormac and Paul:

- Cognateclass notes column looks a bit narrow
- The loan source language is missing -> after the loan
- An additional notes column after the gloss
- Instead of 'loan' say 'loan event'
- Some information (hover or link) that specifies the alias for the cognateclass more,
  so that educated decisions can be made upon that.
  - Maybe to the rh side of the table?!
  - Maybe target ```_blank```?
- Grey out Alias col, ungrey 'Root Language'

- Special cases with one root multiple meanings or something like that?

- Change rh side menu items on page according to trello (Card 31)
- Submit button blocks view
- ```<select>``` for language underneath '1 language [all meanings]'
- For ```/meaning/animal/languagelist/all/```
  - Rename 'Cog. Class Label' to 'Cog. Alias'
- Fix headline (make smaller, thinner)
