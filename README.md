# container
A [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) container with [docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers inside of it.

Aims to help with staging and deployment of some lingdb projects.

As described in [soundcomparisons #217](https://github.com/lingdb/soundcomparisons/issues/217),
it became apparant that a container solution would be useful for our project.
