`/languagelist/all/`
=====
  * Being able to filter by 'Not Swh' would be an improvement
  * Counts wanted are:
    * How many entries in total?!
    * How many meanings have at least one entry?
    * How many meanings don't have an entry? (dual to above)
  * Count from bottom of the site should be displayed at the header
  * Header takes up far to much space
    * Half the height would be enough
    * Counts could be after the headline
  * RH side menu should be in top line as tabs
  * Headers of table should be always visible
  * RH side func to filter individual meaning should be in table header
  * RH side description as hover or linked to /language/Greek/edit/ or similar
    * Same for the meanings

`/languages/`
=====
  * 'Mgs', 'Lex.' and 'Entd' should reflect the discussed counts
    * Mgs is Entd - excluded ?
    * Lex. is Entd - duplicates ?
  * The {Foss,Low}.Stat. Columns should be checkboxes that are mutex on true
  * SndComp code should only 11 digit long inputs or void inputs
  * Make Name col. 5-6 chars wider

`/meaning/I/edit/`
=====
  * Replace 'Notes' field with a link to github wiki page for that meaning
    * Make this link open in a new tab `(target="_blank")`

`/meaning/thou/languagelist/all/`
=====
  * After the headline for 'thou' have a link to the wiki site reading 'full description'

`/wordlist/Swadesh100/`
=====
  * Add '% Lgs coded'
  * One of the blue orbs like in the 'Edit metadata' col after each 'Meaning' entry linking to the wiki, having it's own column reading 'Description'
